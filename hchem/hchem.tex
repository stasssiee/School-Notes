    The Chemistry-Advanced course offers students extensive inquiry experiences in which the major concepts 
    involving chemical changes of matter are developed through experiments and classroom discussion. Experiments and their 
    results are the central aspects of the curriculum. Advanced level research of selected chemistry topics is conducted as 
    independent study under the supervision of the instructor. This course includes topics taught in the regular course but 
    covered in greater detail. Mathematical applications are emphasized.
