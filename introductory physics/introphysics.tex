    8.01 is a first-semester freshman physics class in Newtonian Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, and Kinetic Gas Theory. In addition 
    to the basic concepts of Newtonian Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, and Kinetic Gas Theory, a variety of interesting topics are 
    covered in this course: Binary Stars, Neutron Stars, Black Holes, Resonance Phenomena, Musical Instruments, Stellar Collapse, 
    Supernovae, Astronomical observations from very high flying balloons (lecture 35), and you will be allowed a peek into the 
    intriguing Quantum World.

    8.02 Classical Theory of Electromagnetism. This term I will cover, in addition to the basics, a vast variety of interesting 
    topics including: lightning, pacemakers, electric shock treatment, electrocardiograms, metal detectors, musical instruments, 
    magnetic levitation, bullet trains, electric motors, radios, TV, car coils, superconductivity, aurora borealis, rainbows, 
    radio telescopes, interferometers, particle accelerators (a.k.a. atom smashers or colliders), mass spectrometers, red sunsets, 
    blue skies, haloes around sun and moon, color perception, Doppler effect, super-novae, binary stars, neutron stars, and 
    black holes.
