\begin{center}
    OnRamps Precalculus works through a dual-enrollment model with the University of Texas at Austin. Through a creative and 
    connected approach, students deepen and extend their knowledge of functions, graphs, and equations from their high school 
    Algebra and Geometry courses so that they can successfully work with the concepts in a rigorous university-level calculus 
    course. This course is designed to push students well beyond “drill and kill” exercises, emphasizing conceptual understanding 
    of mathematical definitions and developing logical arguments with peers.
